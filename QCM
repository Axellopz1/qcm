24) The theme dominating global financial markets today is the complexity of risks associated with financial globalization. List and explain examples of the complexity of risks affecting the leading and managing of multinational firms in the rapidly moving marketplace.
Answer: The following is a sampling of this complexity of risks: 1) The international monetary system is under constant scrutiny. The rise of the Chinese renminbi is changing much of the world's outlook on currency exchange, reserve currencies, and the roles of the dollar and the euro. 2) Large fiscal deficits, including the current eurozone crisis, plague most of the major trading countries of the world, complicating fiscal and monetary policies, and ultimately, interest rates and exchange rates. 3) Many countries experience continuing balance of payments imbalances, and in some cases, dangerously large deficits and surpluses. 4) Ownership, control, and governance vary radically across the world. 5) Global capital markets that normally provide the means to lower a firm's cost of capital, and even more critically, increase the availability of capital, have in many ways shrunk in size and have become less open and accessible to many of the world's organizations. 6) Financial globalization has resulted in the ebb and flow of capital in and out of both industrial and emerging markets, greatly complicating financial management.

25) Business involves the interaction of individuals and individual organizations for the exchange of products, services, and capital through markets. The global capital markets are critical for the conduct of this exchange. The authors suggest that one way to characterize the global financial marketplace is through its assets, institutions, and linkages. Explain how each of the three dimensions characterize the global financial marketplace.
Answer: 1) The financial assets at the heart of the global capital markets are the debt securities issued by governments. These low-risk or risk-free assets (e.g., U.S. Treasury Bonds) form the foundation for the creation, trading, and pricing of other financial assets like bank loans, corporate bonds, and equities (stock). In recent years, a number of additional securities have been created from existing securities-derivatives, whose value is based on market value changes of the underlying securities. The health and security of the global financial system relies on the quality of these assets. 2) The institutions of global finance are the central banks, which create and control each country's money supply; the commercial banks, which take deposits and extend loans to businesses, both local and global; and the multitude of other financial institutions created to trade securities and derivatives. These institutions take many shapes and are subject to many different regulatory frameworks. The health and security of the global financial system relies on the stability of these financial institutions. 3) The links between the financial institutions, the actual fluid or medium for exchange, are the interbank networks using currency. The ready exchange of currencies in the global marketplace is the first and foremost necessary element for the conduct of financial trading, and the global currency markets are the largest markets in the world. The exchange of currencies, and the subsequent exchange of all other securities globally via currency, is the international interbank network.

17) Although international trade might have approached the comparative advantage model during the nineteenth century, it certainly does not today, for a variety of reasons. Develop an argument as to why this is not happening today.
Answer: Countries do not appear to specialize only in those products that could be most efficiently produced by that country's particular factors of production. Instead, governments interfere with comparative advantage for a variety of economic and political reasons, such as to achieve full employment, economic development, national self-sufficiency in defense-related industries, and protection of an agricultural sector's way of life. Government interference takes the form of tariffs, quotas, and other non-tariff restrictions. The classical model of comparative advantage also did not really address certain other issues such as the effect of uncertainty and information costs, the role of differentiated products in imperfectly competitive markets, and economies of scale.

Answer: Teams are increasingly virtual and unique, each team custom-tailored for the business proposal or opportunity, and often drawing upon the available talent across geographies, markets, and cultures. Organizational agility, a phrase often used to describe decision-making rather than the decision-makers, requires different skills. This require business professionals who are fundamentally competent over a broader array of functional fields — and that would include more than a passing of knowledge of multinational finance and how impacts investments and operations. Knowledge of the financial dimensions of the business in the international business environment is more and more a concern for all.

Answer: The authors provide 5 strategic motives for firms to become multinationals: market seekers, raw materials seekers, production efficiency seekers, knowledge seekers, and political safety seekers. Market seekers are looking for more consumers for their products such as automobiles or steel. Knowledge seekers may be looking for an educated work force similar to the way firms seeking R and D set up shop in university towns. Raw materials seekers may be after commodities such as oil or copper. Production efficiencies may occur in countries like Mexico that have capable workers and lower wages. Political safety seekers are looking for countries that will not expropriate their assets, so they may stay away from countries that in the post have engaged in such activities.

12) Describe the structural and managerial changes and challenges experienced by a firm as it moves its operations from domestic to global (globalization process).
Answer: A firm's initial strategy is to develop a sustainable competitive advantage in the U.S. market (domestic phase). As firms becomes visible and viable competitors in the U.S. market, strategic opportunities arise to expand the firm's market reach by exporting product and services to one or more foreign markets and/or by importing inputs (international trade phase). If companies are successful in their international trade activities, the time will come when the globalization process will progress to the next phase. Companies will soon need to establish foreign sales and service affiliates. This step is often followed by establishing manufacturing operations abroad or by licensing foreign firms to produce and service (multinational phase). Once companies own assets and enterprises in foreign countries, they have entered the multinational phase of their globalization.

13) The objectives and responsibilities of the modern multinational have grown significantly more complex in the twenty-first century. Develop and argument as to why this is the case. Answer: It is accepted that the purpose of the corporation is to certainly create profits and value for its stakeholders, but the responsibility of the corporation is to do so in a way that inflicts no costs on society, including the environment. This developing controversy has been somewhat hampered to date by conflicting terms and labels—corporate goodness, corporate responsibility, corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate philanthropy, and corporate sustainability, to list but a few. Confusion can be reduced by using a guiding principle—that sustainability is a goal, while responsibility is an obligation. It follows that the obligation of leadership in the modern multinational is to pursue profit, social development, and the environment, all along sustainable principles.

23) Most Western nations were on the gold standard for currency exchange rates from 1876 until 1914. Today we have several different exchange rate regimes in use, but most larger economy nations have freely floating exchange rates today and are not obligated to convert their currency into a predetermined amount of gold on demand. Currently several parties still call for the "good old days" and a return to the gold standard. Develop an argument as to why this is a good idea. Answer: The gold standard forces a nation to maintain sufficient reserves of gold to back its currency's value. This helps control inflation, as a country cannot print additional money without sufficient gold to back it up. The gold standard eases international transactions as there is little uncertainly about exchange rates for trade with foreign countries.

24) The mobility of international capital flows is causing emerging market nations to choose between a free-floating currency exchange regime and a currency board (or taken to the limit, dollarization). Describe how each of the regimes would work and identify at least two likely economic results for each regime.
Answer: With free float the exchange rate is market determined and beyond the control of the country's central bank or government. The economic results are likely to be an independent monetary policy, free movement of capital, but less stability in the exchange rate. Such instability may be more than an emerging market country's small financial market can bear. A currency board on the other hand is an implied legislative commitment to fix the foreign exchange rate with a specific currency, generally the country's major trading partner. Dollarization is taking this policy to the extreme whereby the emerging market nation forgoes its currency for that of its major trading partner. An example of Dollarization is Panama using U.S. dollars as the official Panamanian currency. With such a regime, independent monetary policy is lost and political influence on monetary policy is eliminated. However, the benefits accruing to countries as a result of the ability to print its own money, seigniorage, is lost.

These qualities are termed the impossible trinity because the forces of economics do not allow a country to simultaneously achieve all three goals.

17) Dollarization is the use of the U.S. dollar as the official currency of the country. List and explain the arguments for and against dollarization. Provide example/s of countries that used the dollar as its official currency.
Answer: The arguments for dollarization are: 1) country that dollarizes removes any currency volatility (against the dollar) and would theoretically eliminate the possibility of future currency crises, 2) expectations of greater economic integration with other dollar-based markets, both product and financial. This last point has led many to argue in favor of regional dollarization. Three major arguments exist against dollarization. The first is the loss of sovereignty over monetary policy. This is, however, the point of dollarization. Second, the country loses the power of seigniorage, the ability to profit from its ability to print its own money. Third, the central bank of the country, because it no longer has the ability to create money within its economic and financial system, can no longer serve the role of lender of last resort. This role carries with it the ability to provide liquidity to save financial institutions that may be on the brink of failure during times of financial crisis.

Answer: 1) Vertically, different exchange rate arrangements may dictate whether a country's government has strict intervention requirements (rules) or if it may choose whether, when, and to what degree to intervene in the foreign exchange markets (discretion). 2) Horizontally, the trade- off for countries participating in a specific system is between consulting and acting in unison with other countries (cooperation) or operating as a member of the system, but acting on their own (independence).
Regime structures like the gold standard required no cooperative policies among countries, only the assurance that all would abide by the "rules of the game." Under the gold standard, this assurance translated into the willingness of governments to buy or sell gold at parity rates on demand. The Bretton Woods Agreement, the system in place between 1944 and 1973, required more in the way of cooperation, in that gold was no longer the "rule," and countries were required to cooperate to a higher degree to maintain the dollar-based system. Exchange rate systems, like the European Monetary System's (EMS) fixed exchange rate band system used from 1979 to 1999, were hybrids of these cooperative and rule regimes.

20) The measurement of all international economic transactions that take place between the residents of a country and foreign residents is called the balance of payments (BOP). List and explain three reasons why host-country BOP data is important to managers and investors. Answer: BOP data is also important for the following reasons: 1) The BOP is an important indicator of pressure on a country's foreign exchange rate, and thus of the potential for a firm trading with or investing in that country to experience foreign exchange gains or losses. Changes in the BOP may predict the imposition or removal of foreign exchange controls. 2) Changes in a country's BOP may signal the imposition or removal of controls over payment of dividends and interest, license fees, royalty fees, or other cash disbursements to foreign firms or investors. 3) The BOP helps to forecast a country's market potential, especially in the short run. A country experiencing a serious trade deficit is not as likely to expand imports as it would be if running a surplus. It may, however, welcome investments that increase its exports.

Answer: The balance of trade (BOT) is the largest and most important subset of a country's current account. It measures the difference in a country's imports and exports over a specified time period. It is often reported because it is intuitively easy to understand (i.e., we either sell more or buy more from foreign countries) and it is a reasonable representation of the total current account balance. (For example, for the U.S. the BOT was -$343B in 1999 while the current account balance was -$807B in 2017.

Answer: The ORA is the total reserves held by official monetary authorities within the country. Under a fixed exchange regime, a country's currency is convertible into a fixed amount of another country's currency. To keep the relationship between currencies at equilibrium, it may become necessary for the government to buy or sell official reserves until the equilibrium is restored. Under a variable rate regime this is not necessary as exchange rates are allowed to change and official reserves no longer serve the same purpose as under the fixed rate regime. Diff: 3

13) Very often governments seek to alter the market's valuation of their currency by influencing relative interest rates, thus influencing the economic fundamentals of exchange rate determination rather than through direct intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Describe how this strategy works. Describe the case of the U.S. or China where the opposite effect, to the suggest here, have occurred.
Answer: A country may choose to raise domestic interest rates to attract additional capital from abroad (the short-term portfolio component of these capital flows). This step will alter market forces and create additional market demand for the domestic currency in order to restore an imbalance caused by the deficit in the current account. The process also raises the cost of local borrowing for businesses so the policy is seldom without domestic negative consequences. Relatively low real interest rates should normally stimulate an outflow of capital seeking higher interest rates in other country currencies. However, in the case of the United States, the opposite effect has occurred. Despite relatively low real interest rates and large BOP deficits on the current account, the U.S. BOP financial account has experienced offsetting financial inflows due to relatively attractive U.S. growth rate prospects, high levels of productive innovation, and perceived political safety. Thus, the financial account inflows have helped the United States to maintain its lower interest rates and to finance its exceptionally large fiscal deficit. However, it is beginning to appear that the favorable inflow on the financial account is diminishing while the U.S. balance on the current account is worsening.

5) Countries occasionally intentionally devalue their currencies. So what is the logic and likely results of intentionally devaluing their domestic currency? International economic analysis characterizes the trade balance adjustment process as occurring in three stages. List and explain the three stages too.
Answer: International economic analysis characterizes the trade balance adjustment process as occurring in three stages: 1) the currency contract period; 2) the pass-through period; and 3) the quantity adjustment period. Assuming that the trade balance is already in deficit prior to the devaluation, a devaluation at time results initially in a further deterioration in the trade balance before an eventual improvement. The path of adjustment, as shown, takes on the shape of a flattened "j."
In the currency contract period, a sudden unexpected devaluation of the domestic currency will deteriorate the trade balance simply because all the contracts for exports and imports are already in effect. Firms operating under these agreements are required to fulfill their obligations, regardless of whether they profit or suffer losses. In the pass-through period, as exchange rates change, importers and exporters eventually must pass these exchange rate changes through to their own product prices. Import prices rise and export prices are now cheaper compared to foreign competitors' because the dollar is cheaper. The third and final period, the quantity adjustment period, achieves the balance of trade adjustment that is expected from a domestic currency devaluation or depreciation. As the import and export prices change as a result of the pass-through period, consumers both in the United States and in the U.S. export markets adjust their demands to the new prices. Imports are relatively more expensive; therefore, the quantity demanded decreases. Exports are relatively cheaper; therefore, the quantity demanded increases. The balance of trade—the expenditures on exports less the expenditures on imports—improves. Diff: 2

What was the cause of this sudden influx of capital, and what types of potential problems did it have for the Dutch or could it have for any small single resource country?
Answer: With the rapid growth of the natural gas industry in the Netherlands in the 1970s, there was growing fear that massive capital inflows would drive up the demand for the Dutch guilder and cause a substantial currency appreciation. A more expensive guilder would then reduce the international competitiveness of other Dutch manufacturing industries, causing their relative decline to that of the natural resource industry. This is a challenge faced by a number of resource-rich economies of relatively modest size and relatively small export sectors.

42) One of the most challenging issues in the financial management of the enterprise is the possible separation of ownership from management resulting in the so-called principal agent problem. Define the agency problem, explain possible ways to alleviate the agency problem and discuss differences in across global markets.
Answer: The separation of ownership from management raises the possibility that the two entities may have different business and financial objectives. This is the so-called principal agent problem. There are several strategies for aligning shareholder and management interests, the most common of which is for senior management to own shares or share options. What is then good for the managers' own personal wealth is similar to that of general shareholders.
The United States and United Kingdom are two country markets characterized by wide-spread ownership of shares. Management may own some small portion of stock in their firms, but largely management is a hired agent that is expected to represent the interests of shareholders. In contrast, many firms in many other global markets are characterized by controlling shareholders such as government, institutions (e.g., banks in Germany), family (e.g., in France, Italy, and throughout Asia and Latin America), and consortiums of interests (e.g., keiretsus in Japan and chaebols in South Korea). A business that is owned and managed by the same entity does not suffer the agency problem.

43) Describe the management objectives of a firm governed by the shareholder wealth maximization model and one governed by the stakeholder wealth maximization model. Give an example of how these two models may lead to different decision-making by executive management.
Answer: Shareholder wealth maximization attempts to do just that, typically through the maximization of share price. Stakeholder wealth maximization is much more difficult because of the necessity to satisfy many stakeholders all having approximately equal claim on the objectives of management. These stakeholders may include shareholders, creditors, customers, employees, and community. Differing decisions may occur in a situation that involves significant social costs. For example, in the U.S. the decision to shift production from a local factory to a foreign one may be in large based on the change in NPV as the result of the move with only minor consideration of the impact that a change in location would have on the community at large or the local employees. A manager of a stakeholder driven firm may place equal or greater emphasis on the local employees and community and choose to maintain the current facility rather than move even if the foreign operation provided a much greater NPV. Ultimately, the latter may cause an inefficient allocation of scarce resources and lead to an overall lower standard of living.

44) Define patient and impatient capitalism and discuss how each may lead to different decision- making in the shareholder wealth maximization model.
Answer: Patient capitalism may be defined as a focus on long-term shareholder wealth maximization and is often associated with management focusing on long-term investments with less emphasis placed on short-term or trendy objectives. On the other hand, impatient capitalism could be described as a destructive focus on the short term by both management and investors. These differences in the time horizon could lead to different and perhaps inferior decisions by existing management and ultimately be costly to the shareholders.

7) The decline of share listings in the United States has led to considerable debate over whether these trends represent a fundamental global business shift away from the publicly traded corporate form, or something that is more U.S.-centric combined with the economic times. Develop an argument to why the decline happened.
Answer: One recent study argued that it was not really the increasingly burdensome U.S. regulatory environment that was to blame, but rather a proliferation of factors that caused the decline in market making, sales, and research support for small and medium-sized equities. Beginning with the introduction of online brokerage in 1996 and online trading rules in 1997, more and more equity trading in the United States shifted to electronic communication networks which allowed all market participants to trade directly with the exchange order books, and not through brokers or brokerage houses. Although this increased competition reduced transaction costs dramatically, it also undermined the profitability of the retail brokerage houses, which had always supported research, market making, and sales and promotion of the small- to medium- sized equities. Without this financial support, the smaller stocks were no longer covered and promoted by the major equity houses. Without that research, marketing, promotion and coverage, their trading volumes and values fell.

Answer: The foreign exchange market is the mechanism by which participants transfer purchasing power between countries by exchanging money, obtain or provide credit for international trade transactions, and minimize exposure to the risks of exchange rate changes.
1) The transfer of purchasing power is necessary because international trade and capital transactions normally involve parties living in countries with different national currencies. Usually each party wants to deal in its own currency, but the trade or capital transaction can be invoiced in only one currency. Hence, one party must deal in a foreign currency. 2) Because the movement of goods between countries takes time, inventory in transit must be financed. The foreign exchange market provides a source of credit. Specialized instruments, such as bankers' acceptances and letters of credit are available to finance international trade. 3) The foreign exchange market provides "hedging" facilities for transferring foreign exchange risk to someone else more willing to carry risk.

Answer: Spot transactions are exchanging one currency for another right now. Spot transactions are typically entered into because the parties need to exchange foreign currencies that they have received into their domestic currency, or because they have an obligation that requires them to obtain foreign currency.
Forward foreign exchange transactions are agreements entered into today to exchange currencies at a particular price at some point in the future. Forwards may be speculative or a hedge against unexpected changes in the price of the other currency.
Swaps are the simultaneous purchase and sale of a given amount of a foreign exchange for two different dates. Both transactions are conducted with the same counterparty. A swap may be considered a technique for borrowing another currency on a fully collateralized basis.

20) A bid is the price in one currency at which a dealer will buy another currency. An ask is the price at which a dealer will sell the other currency. Dealers bid (buy) at one price and ask (sell) at a slightly higher price, making their profit from the spread between the prices. List and explain three reasons/factors that could make the spread small.
Answer: The bid-ask spread may be quite large for currencies that are traded infrequently, in small volumes, or both. The spread in wholesale transactions between banks and large corporations is normally smaller than in the retail market. Competition among dealers worldwide narrows the spread between bids and offers and so contributes to making the foreign exchange market "efficient" in the same sense as are securities markets. Other factors that affect the spread are the cost of processing orders, the cost of maintaining an inventory of a particular currency, and the volatility in the value of a currency.

24) The authors state that empirical tests of purchasing power parity "have, for the most part, not proved PPP to be accurate in predicting future exchange rates." The authors then state that PPP does hold up reasonably well in two situations. What are some reasons why PPP does not accurately predict future exchange rates, and under what conditions might we reasonably expect PPP to hold?
Answer: PPP does not hold because goods and services do not move without cost between countries and markets. Often, goods and services are nor perfect substitutes in every market for reasons of availability, taste, quality, and production techniques. Having said that, PPP does appear to work reasonably well over the long run and especially in countries with higher rates of inflation and underdeveloped capital markets.

25) The Big Mac is considered a good candidate for the application of the law of one price and measurement of under- or overvaluation of a currency. Develop an argument as to why this is a good idea.
Answer: First, the product itself is nearly identical in each market. This is the result of product consistency, process excellence, and McDonald's brand image and pride. Second, and just as important, the product is a result of predominantly local materials and input costs. This means that its price in each country is representative of domestic costs and prices and not imported ones, which would be influenced by exchange rates themselves. The index, however, still possesses limitations. Big Macs cannot be traded across borders, and costs and prices are influenced by a variety of other factors in each country market, such as real estate rental rates and taxes.

26) Explain the logic behind the application of the PPP theory to explain changes in the spot exchange rate.
Answer: The logic behind the application of PPP to changes in the spot exchange rate is that if a country experiences inflation rates higher than those of its main trading partners, and its exchange rate does not change, its exports of goods and services become less competitive with comparable products produced elsewhere. Imports from abroad become more price-competitive with higher-priced domestic products. These price changes lead to a deficit on the current account in the balance of payments unless offset by capital and financial flows.

25) The authors describe an application of uncovered interest arbitrage (UIA) known as "yen carry trade." Define UIA and describe the example of yen carry trade. Why would an investor engage in the practice of yen carry trade and is there any risk of loss or lesser profit from this investment strategy?
Answer: UIA is the practice of investors borrowing money in countries where interest rates are relatively low, converting the loan proceeds into a currency where rates are relatively high, investing at the higher rate, subsequently converting the proceeds back into the original currency to repay the proceeds from the loan and hopefully realizing a greater return from this practice than if the borrowing and investing had all taken place in the original currency. The arbitrage is uncovered because at the time of the investment the investor does not lock in a forward exchange rate and therefore bears the risk that currency exchange rates will change in an unfavorable manner. The yen carry trade exists because rates in Japan are so very low that investors borrow yen, convert to another currency, say U.S. dollars, invest at much higher interest rates, often in default-risk free Treasury securities, then convert back to yen, repay the original loan and walk away with a significantly greater return than otherwise available. The risk in this process is neither from the investment nor from the loan. The risk is that exchange rates may change unfavorably and the investor takes a loss rather than a profit.

26) The Fisher Effect is a familiar economic theory in the domestic market. In words, define the Fisher Effect and explain why you think it is also appropriately applied to international markets. Answer: Irving Fisher was an early 20th century economist who hypothesized that all market determined nominal interest rates had at least two basic components. First, a real return is required to compensate investors for postponing current consumption. This real rate is constant and unaffected by expectations about inflation. Second, an expected inflation component is required so that investors would not expect to lose purchasing power by the act of forgoing current consumption. Intuitively, if capital can move freely among international markets these same requirements must exist in each of the capital markets and the Fisher Effect would apply internationally as well as domestically.

7) Some forecasters believe that foreign exchange markets for the major floating currencies are "efficient" and forward exchange rates are unbiased predictors of future spot exchange rates. Explain the rationale of this statement including the assumptions made, the meaning of "efficient" and "unbiased," and the empirical evidence.
Answer: If the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate, the expected value of the future spot rate at time 2 equals the present forward rate for time 2 delivery, available now, E1(S2) = F1,2. Intuitively, this means that the distribution of possible actual spot rates in the
future is centered on the forward rate. The fact that it is an unbiased predictor, however, does not mean that the future spot rate will actually be equal to what the forward rate predicts. Unbiased prediction simply means that the forward rate will, on average, overestimate and underestimate the actual future spot rate in equal frequency and degree. The forward rate may, in fact, never actually equal the future spot rate.
The rationale for this relationship is based on the hypothesis that the foreign exchange market is reasonably efficient. Market efficiency assumes that 1) All relevant information is quickly reflected in both the spot and forward exchange markets; 2) Transaction costs are low; and
3) Instruments denominated in different currencies are perfect substitutes for one another. Empirical studies of the efficient foreign exchange market hypothesis have yielded conflicting results. Nevertheless, a consensus is developing that rejects the efficient market hypothesis. It appears that the forward rate is not an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate and that it does pay to use resources to attempt to forecast exchange rates.

19) Why are foreign currency futures contracts more popular with individuals and banks while foreign currency forwards are more popular with businesses?
Answer: Foreign currency futures are standardized contracts that lend themselves well to speculation purposes but less so for hedging purposes. The standardized nature of the futures contract makes it easy to trade futures and to make bets about general changes in the value of currencies. Forward contracts are better for hedging in that they are tailored to meet the specific needs of the client, typically a business, and can be quite useful in reducing exchange rate risk. Banks are involved in the foreign currency futures market in part to offset positions that they may have taken in the forward markets as dealers.

28) Compare and contrast foreign currency options and futures. Identify situations when you may prefer one vs. the other when speculating on foreign exchange.
Answer: Foreign currency futures are derivative securities that allow the holder to lock in a price today for another currency at some point in the future. The foreign currency future contract is an obligation on the part of the parties to fulfill the terms of the contract. Even if prices change in an unanticipated way, the parties are obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract. The foreign currency option contract on the other hand is a right not an obligation to purchase/sell a currency at some point in the future at a price agreed upon today. If prices change in an unexpected manner, the buyer of the contract is under no obligation to exercise the contract. Option contracts are better suited to situations where price changes are anticipated, but the direction of the change is highly uncertain.

6) Define and explain the logic for the time value of an option. Explain the value of the time value of an option for deep out-of-the money and deep in-the-money options.
Answer: The time value of an option exists because the price of the underlying currency, the spot rate, can potentially move further and further into the money before the option's expiration. Time value is the area between the total value of the option and its intrinsic value. An investor will pay something today for an out-of-the-money option (i.e., zero intrinsic value) on the chance that the spot rate will move far enough before maturity to move the option in-the-money. Consequently, the price of an option is always somewhat greater than its intrinsic value, since there is always some chance — some might say 'hope everlasting' — that the intrinsic value will rise by the expiration date. For deep out-of-the money and deep in-the-money options the value of the time value of an option is insignificant since the chances for the option to increase in value are slim.

5) For a corporate borrower, it is especially important to distinguish between credit risk and repricing risk. Explain both types of risks.
Answer: Credit risk, sometimes termed roll-over risk, is the possibility that a borrower's creditworthiness at the time of renewing a credit — its credit rating — is reclassified by the lender. This can result in changing fees, changing interest rates, altered credit line commitments, or even denial. Repricing risk is the risk of changes in interest rates charged (earned) at the time a financial contract's rate is reset. A borrower that is renewing a credit will face current market conditions on the base rate used for financing, a true floating-rate.

Instruction 8.1:
For the following problem(s), consider these debt strategies being considered by a corporate borrower. Each is intended to provide $1,000,000 in financing for a three-year period.
• Strategy #1: Borrow $1,000,000 for three years at a fixed rate of interest of 7%.
• Strategy #2: Borrow $1,000,000 for three years at a floating rate of LIBOR + 2%, to be reset annually. The current LIBOR rate is 3.50%
• Strategy #3: Borrow $1,000,000 for one year at a fixed rate, and then renew the credit annually. The current one-year rate is 5%.
1) Refer to Instruction 8.1. Choosing strategy #1 will:
A) guarantee the lowest average annual rate over the next three years.
B) eliminate credit risk but retain repricing risk.
C) maintain the possibility of lower interest costs, but maximizes the combined credit and repricing risks.

Answer: The asset market approach to exchange rate determination looks at relative interest rates and prospects for economic growth and profitability. This is consistent with the pricing of equity securities in that the price of a share of stock should reflect expectations about the timing, magnitude, and risk of future cash flows. In other words, expectations about what is to come is more important to the price of an asset, including currency prices, than what has occurred in the past.

15) Explain how a central bank would engage in direct intervention to decrease the value of its domestic currency. Since the 1970s, it has been difficult for central banks alone to engage in direct intervention to alter the value of their domestic currency. Identify and explain at least two other activities in which a central bank could engage to alter the value of their domestic currency.
Answer: To decrease the value of its domestic currency, a central bank could choose to sell its own currency, thus making more of its currency available and driving down its value. Because markets have become so large, it is difficult to effectively move the market in this manner.
Alternative strategies may be to enlist other central banks to make a coordinated effort to sell the currency into the market, thus putting more currency into play and having a greater negative impact on its value. Indirect intervention to drive down real interest rates is a second alternative, and the reduction of capital controls may be able to render a currency less valuable as well.

20) In 1991, Argentina adopted a currency board (the Argentine peso had been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a one-to-one rate of exchange) to fight hyperinflation. This currency board lasted for a decade until the economic crisis of 2001. Discuss: 1) the pros and cons of a currency board policy, 2) the crisis condition of the Argentina's economy by 2001, and 3) the lessons to be drawn from the Argentina story.
Answer: Under a currency board, the central bank may increase the money supply in the banking system only with increases in its holdings of hard currency reserves. By removing the ability of government to expand the rate of growth of the money supply, Argentina believed it was eliminating the source of inflation that had devastated its standard of living. It was both a recipe for conservative and prudent financial management, and a decision to eliminate the power of politicians, elected and unelected, to exercise judgment both good and bad. It was an automatic and unbendable rule.
This "cure" was a restrictive monetary policy that slowed economic growth. The country's unemployment rate rose to double-digit levels in 1994 and stayed there. The real GDP growth rate settled into recession in late 1998, and the economy continued to shrink through 2000. Argentine banks allowed depositors to hold their money in either pesos or dollars. This was intended to provide a market-based discipline to the banking and political systems, and to demonstrate the government's unwavering commitment to maintaining the peso's value parity with the dollar. Although intended to build confidence in the system, in the end it proved disastrous to the Argentine banking system. The 1998 recession proved to be unending. Three- and-a-half years later, Argentina was still in recession. By 2001, crisis conditions had revealed three very important underlying problems with Argentina's economy: 1) The Argentine peso was overvalued; 2) The currency board regime had eliminated monetary policy alternatives for macroeconomic policy; and 3) The Argentine government budget deficit was out of control. Inflation had not been eliminated, and the world's markets were watching.
As the unemployment rate grew higher, as poverty and social unrest grew government was faced with pressure to close the economic and social gaps. Government spending continued to increase, but tax receipts did not. Argentina turned to the international markets to aid in the financing of its government's deficit spending. The total foreign debt of the country began rising dramatically. As economic conditions continued to deteriorate, banks suffered increasing runs. The government, fearing that the increasing financial drain on banks would cause their collapse, closed the banks.
On Sunday, January 6, 2002 the peso was devalued from 1.00 Argentine peso per U.S. dollar to 1.40. But the economic pain continued. On February 3, 2002, the Argentine government announced that the peso would be floated and the government would no longer attempt to fix or manage its value to any specific level, allowing the market to find or set the exchange rate.

9) Foreign exchange forecasting can be either long-term, or short-term in duration. Compare and contrast the motivation for and the techniques a forecaster might use for each of the time periods. Answer: Short-run forecasts are usually more tactical in nature as a firm may desire to reduce exchange rate risk associated with foreign receivable or payables. Technical factors and short- term market expectations are often more important for short-run forecasters than long-run parity or fundamental economic conditions.
Long-run forecasts are more strategic in nature as firms make key decisions about entering new foreign markets. Longer time horizons tend to be less accurate but also require less accuracy. What forecasters typically desire is a general long-run understanding of the relationships between markets. Fundamental analysis and parity conditions tend to be more important than technical factors in this type of forecasting.

15) Does foreign currency exchange hedging both reduce risk and increase expected value? Explain, and list several arguments in favor of currency risk management and several against. Answer: Foreign exchange currency hedging can reduce the variability of foreign currency receivables or payables by locking in a specific exchange rate in the future via a forward contract, converting currency at the current spot rate using a money market hedge, or minimizing unfavorable exchange rate movement with a currency option. None of these hedging techniques, however, increases the expected value of the foreign currency exchange. In fact, expected value should fall by an amount equal to the cost of the hedge.
Generally, those in favor of currency risk management find value in the reduction of variability of uncertain cash flows. Those opposed to currency risk management argue the NPV of such activities are $0 or less and that shareholders can reduce risk themselves more efficiently.

Instruction 10.1:
Use the information for the following problem(s).
Central Valley Transit Inc. (CVT) has just signed a contract to purchase light rail cars from a manufacturer in Germany for €3,000,000. The purchase was made in June with payment due six months later in December. Because this is a sizable contract for the firm and because the contract is in euros rather than dollars, CVT is considering several hedging alternatives to reduce the exchange rate risk arising from the sale. To help the firm make a hedging decision you have gathered the following information.
• The spot exchange rate is $1.250/euro
• The six-month forward rate is $1.22/euro
• CVT's cost of capital is 11%
• The Euro zone 6-month borrowing rate is 9% (or 4.5% for 6 months)
• The Euro zone 6-month lending rate is 7% (or 3.5% for 6 months)
• The U.S. 6-month borrowing rate is 8% (or 4% for 6 months)
• The U.S. 6-month lending rate is 6% (or 3% for 6 months)
• December call options for euro 750,000; strike price $1.28, premium price is 1.5%
• CVT's forecast for 6-month spot rates is $1.27/euro
• The budget rate, or the highest acceptable purchase price for this project, is $3,900,000 or $1.30/euro

6) There are as many different approaches to foreign exchange transaction exposure management as there are firms and no real consensus exists regarding the best approach. List and discuss three different exposures you can hedge and three different types of hedges (for example option hedges versus non-option hedges).
Answer: Foreign exchange exposure is a measure of the potential for a firm's profitability, net cash flow, and market value to change because of a change in exchange rates. There are two distinct categories of foreign exchange exposure for the firm: 1) Accounting exposure (transaction exposure and translation exposure) arises from contracts and accounts being denominated in foreign currency, 2) Economic exposure is the potential change in the value of the firm from its changing global competitiveness as determined by exchange rates.
A transaction exposure is created at the first moment the seller quotes a price in foreign currency terms to a potential buyer (quotation exposure). When the order is placed, the potential exposure created at the time of the quotation is converted into actual exposure, called backlog exposure, because the product has not yet been shipped or billed. Backlog exposure lasts until the goods are shipped and billed, at which time it becomes billing exposure. Billing exposure remains until payment is received by the seller.
Transaction exposure management programs are generally divided along an "option-line," those that use options (calls and puts) and those that do not (forward/futures contracts and money market hedges).

7) Many MNEs have established rigid transaction exposure risk management policies which mandate proportional hedging (a percentage of existing transaction exposures). Explain the pros and cons of proportional hedging.
Answer: First of all, hedging is expensive. These policies generally require the use of forward contract hedges on a percentage (e.g., 50, 60, or 70%) of existing transaction exposures. As the maturity of the exposures lengthens, the percentage forward-cover required decreases. The remaining portion of the exposure is then selectively hedged on the basis of the firm's risk tolerance, view of exchange rate movements, and confidence level. Although rarely acknowledged by the firms themselves, selective hedging is essentially speculation. A significant question remains as to whether a firm or a financial manager can consistently predict the future direction of exchange rates.

12) There are as many different approaches to exposure management as there are firms and no real consensus exists regarding the best approach. Discuss the following theoretical dimensions to currency hedging: optimal hedge ratio, hedge symmetry, hedge effectiveness and hedge timing.
Answer: The objective of currency hedging is to minimize the change in the value of the exposed asset or cash flow from a change in exchange rates. Hedging is accomplished by combining the exposed asset with a hedge asset to create a two-asset portfolio in which the two assets react in relatively equal but opposite directions to an exchange rate change. If the entire exposure was covered, that is a hedge ratio of 1.0 or 100%. The hedge ratio, β, is the percentage of an individual exposure's nominal amount covered by a financial instrument such as a forward contract or currency option.
Some hedges can be constructed to result in no change in value to any and all exchange rate changes. The hedge is constructed so that whatever spot value is lost (or gained) as a result of ad erse (or fa ora le) exchan e rate mo ements (   pot), that  alue is replaced    an equal  ut opposite chan e in the  alue of the hed e asset, (   ed e). The 1    forward contract cover is symmetrical hedge.
The effectiveness of a hedge is determined to what degree the change in spot asset's value is correlated with the equal but opposite change in the hedge asset's value to a change in the underlying spot exchange rate. The less than perfect correlation is termed basis risk.
The hedger must also determine the timing of the hedge objective. The hedger can protect the value of the exposed asset only at the time of its maturity or settlement, or at various points in time over the life of the exposure.

16) Most countries specify the translation method to be used by a foreign subsidiary based on its business operations or the functional currency. Explain both subsidiary characterization criteria and the one adopted in the United States.
Answer: A foreign subsidiary's business can be categorized as either an integrated foreign entity or a self-sustaining foreign entity. An integrated foreign entity is one that operates as an extension of the parent company, with cash flows and general business lines that are highly interrelated with those of the parent. A self-sustaining foreign entity is one that operates in the local economic environment independent of the parent company. The differentiation is important to the logic of translation. A foreign subsidiary should be valued principally in terms of the currency that is the basis of its economic viability. It is not unusual for a single company to have both types of foreign subsidiaries, integrated and self-sustaining.
A foreign subsidiary's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates and in which it generates cash flows. In other words, it is the dominant currency used by that foreign subsidiary in its day-to-day operations. It is important to note that the geographic location of a foreign subsidiary and its functional currency may be different.
The United States, rather than distinguishing a foreign subsidiary as either integrated or self- sustaining, requires that the functional currency of the subsidiary be determined. Management must evaluate the nature and purpose of each of its individual foreign subsidiaries to determine the appropriate functional currency for each. If a foreign subsidiary of a U.S.-based company is determined to have the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, it is essentially an extension of the parent company (equivalent to the integrated foreign entity designation used by most countries). If, however, the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is determined to be different from the U.S. dollar, the subsidiary is considered a separate entity from the parent (equivalent to the self-sustaining entity designation).

20) The two methods for the translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are the current rate and temporal methods. Briefly, describe how each of these methods translates the foreign subsidiary financial statements into the parent company's consolidated statements. Identify when each technique should be used and the major advantage(s) of each.
Answer: The current rate method translates almost all line items from the foreign subsidiary to the parent consolidated statements at the current exchange rate. This is the most commonly used method in the world today. Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rate and items found on the income statement are translated at the actual exchange rate on the date of transaction, or as an average over the statement period where appropriate. Equity accounts are translated at historical costs.
Any gains or losses caused by translation adjustments are typically placed into a special reserve account (such as a CTA). Thus, gains or losses do not go through the income statement and do not increase the volatility of net income. This is perhaps the biggest advantage to using the current rate method.
By contrast, the temporal method assumes that several individual financial statement items are periodically restated to reflect their market value. The temporal method translates individual line items based on monetary/nonmonetary criteria where monetary assets such as cash and marketable securities are translated at current exchange rates, but nonmonetary assets such as fixed assets are translated at historical rates. The gains or losses that result from translation remeasurement are recorded on the consolidated income statement and impact upon the volatility of net income. The temporal method of using historical costs may be more consistent with the practice of carrying domestic items at cost on the financial statements.

5) The value contribution of a subsidiary of a multinational firm to the firm can be reported in the income statement or balance sheet of the consolidated firm. Explain the reporting of the changes in the value of a subsidiary as a result of the change in an exchange rate — changes to the income and the assets of the subsidiary — in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
Answer: The earnings of the subsidiary, once remeasured into the home currency of the parent company, contributes directly to the consolidated income of the firm. An exchange rate change results in fluctuations in the value of the subsidiary's income to the global corporation. If the individual subsidiary in question constitutes a relatively significant or material component of consolidated income, the multinational firm's reported income (and earnings per share, EPS) may be seen to change purely as a result of translation.
Changes in the reporting currency value of the net assets of the subsidiary are passed into consolidated income or equity. If the foreign subsidiary was designated as "dollar functional," remeasurement results in a transaction exposure, which is passed through current consolidated income. If the foreign subsidiary was designated as "local currency functional," translation results in a translation adjustment and is reported in consolidated equity as a translation adjustment. It does not alter reported consolidated net income.

13) Describe a balance sheet hedge and give at least two examples of when such a hedge could be justified.
Answer: A balance sheet hedge attempts to equalize the amount of assets and liabilities of a foreign subsidiary exposed to translation risk. Thus, the gain to the firm from a change in exchange rates will be perfectly offset by an equal and opposite loss. Firms may engage in balance sheet hedges under conditions of hyperinflation, or when the subsidiary is about to be liquidated and the value of the CTA account would be realized.

14) An unexpected change in exchange rates impacts a firm's expected cash flows at three levels, depending on the time horizon used (Short Run, Medium Run, and Long Run). Describe the three operating exposure's phases of adjustment assuming that parity conditions do not hold among foreign exchange rates, national inflation rates, and national interest rates (disequilibrium).
Answer: The first level impact is on expected cash flows in the one-year operating budget. The gain or loss depends on the currency of denomination of expected cash flows. These are both existing transaction exposures and anticipated exposures. The currency of denomination cannot be changed for existing obligations, or even for implied obligations such as purchase or sales commitments. In the short run it is difficult to change sales prices or renegotiate factor costs. Therefore, realized cash flows will differ from those expected in the budget.
The second level impact is on expected medium-run cash flows assuming disequilibrium conditions. In this case, the firm may not be able to adjust prices and costs to reflect the new competitive realities caused by a change in exchange rates. The primary problem may be the reactions of existing competitors. The firm's realized cash flows will differ from its expected cash flows. The firm's market value may change because of the unanticipated results.
The third level impact is on expected long-run cash flows, meaning those beyond five years. At this strategic level a firm's cash flows will be influenced by the reactions of both existing competitors and potential competitors-possible new entrants-to exchange rate changes under disequilibrium conditions. In fact, all firms that are subject to international competition, whether they are purely domestic or multinational, are exposed to foreign exchange operating exposure in the long run whenever foreign exchange markets are not continuously in equilibrium.

Answer: An MNE well known in the financial markets could borrow money in a country in which the firm receives foreign currency. The MNE could then use the receivables to repay the loan in the foreign currency and avoid uncertainties in exchange rates.
An MNE could establish production facilities in several countries. This could be beneficial in at least two ways. First, such diversification reduces the probability of unfavorable changes in exchange rates for one country from significantly reducing the firm's profitability. Second, an MNE with facilities in several countries is well positioned by using internal sources to recognize when a disequilibrium in the market arises.

26) A British firm has a subsidiary in the U.S., and a U.S. firm, known to the British firm, has a subsidiary in Britain. Define and then provide an example for each of the following management techniques for reducing the firm's operating cash flows. The following are techniques to consider:
a) matching currency cash flows
b) risk-sharing agreements
c) back-to-back or parallel loans
Answer:
a) Matching currency cash flows requires that the British firm with dollar receivables must establish an equivalent dollar payable. They could do this by borrowing dollars and repaying the loan with the proceeds from the receivables account. Or they could move all or part of their operations to the U.S. so that both receivables and payables would be in U.S. dollars.
b) Risk-sharing agreements are contractual clauses whereby both parties agree to an acceptable range of exchange rates at the time the international sale is made. A spot rate at time of exchange outside of the agreed upon range results in an adjustment made to the actual exchange rate that shares the difference between the spot rate and the acceptable range of exchange rates.
c) Back-to-back loans provide for parent-subsidiary cross border financing without incurring direct currency exposure. For example, using our British and U.S. firms, the British firm could lend pounds to the U.S. subsidiary in Britain at the same time that the U.S. firm lends an equivalent amount of dollars to the British subsidiary in the U.S. Later, the loans would be simultaneously repaid.

29) What are the components of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and how do they differ for an MNE compared to a purely domestic firm?
Answer: The WACC considers the proportion or weight of assets financed with debt and the proportion financed with equity. It also looks at the costs of debt and equity financing and the firm's corporate tax rate. The difficulty of such a computation is compounded for an MNE because there are several additional sources of debt financing with different required rates of return and tax rates for an MNE than for a domestic firm. Also, equity may be sourced in several different markets and subject to several different regulations of several different countries. Adding regulatory oversight, multiple sourcing locations, and differing investor expectations may significantly complicate the process of determining an MNE's cost of capital.

24) There are potential benefits and risks from raising capital on global markets. Discuss the pros and cons in terms of risk of raising capital on global markets.
Answer: A portfolio of international stocks represents a portfolio in which foreign securities have been added. It has the same overall risk shape as the U.S. stock portfolio, but it has a lower portfolio beta. This means that the international portfolio's market risk is lower than that of a domestic portfolio. This situation arises because the returns on the foreign stocks are not perfectly correlated with U.S. stocks (the benefits of international diversification).
The foreign exchange risks of a portfolio, whether it is a securities portfolio or the general portfolio of activities of the MNE, are reduced through international diversification. But international portfolio construction is also different in that when the investor acquires assets or securities from outside the investor's host-country market, the investor may also be acquiring a foreign currency-denominated asset. Thus, the investor has actually acquired two additional assets—the currency of denomination and the asset subsequently purchased with the currency— one asset in principle, but two in expected returns and risks. You should see, however, that the presence of currency risk may alter the correlations associated with securities in different countries and currencies.

18) Most observers believe that for better or for worse, we have achieved a global market for securities. Discuss the major changes in the international markets of securities: during the 1980s, during the 1990s and the current conditions.
Answer: During the 1980s, numerous firms cross-listed on major foreign exchanges and were successful in lowering their WACC and increasing its availability. During the 1990s, national restrictions on cross-border portfolio investment were gradually eased under pressure from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Liberalization of European securities markets was accelerated because of the European Union's efforts to develop a single European market without barriers. Emerging nation markets followed suit, as did the former Eastern Bloc countries after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Emerging national markets have often been motivated by the need to source foreign capital to finance large-scale privatization.
Now, market segmentation has been significantly reduced, although the liquidity of individual national markets remains limited. The good news is that many firms have been assisted to become MNEs because they now have access to a global cost and availability of capital. The bad news is that the correlation among securities markets has increased, thereby reducing, but not eliminating, the benefits of international portfolio diversification. Globalization of securities markets has also led to more volatility and speculative behavior, as shown by the emerging market crises of the 1995-2001 period, and the 2008-2009 global credit crisis.

12) What do theory and empirical evidence say about capital structure and the cost of capital for MNEs versus their domestic counterparts?
Answer: In theory, MNEs should be able to support greater amounts of debt due to reduced variability of cash flows brought about by diversification across countries. And, because of this reduced risk borne by MNEs, they should also have a lower cost of capital. However, empirical research finds that domestic firms tend to use greater amounts of short and intermediate debt than do MNEs and that the cost of capital is greater for MNEs due to increased agency costs, political risk, exchange rate risk, and asymmetric information.

8) Sourcing capital abroad usually follows a logic path. List in sequential order three corporate strategies in internationalizing the cost of capital.
Answer: Most firms raise their initial capital in their own domestic market. Most firms should start sourcing abroad with an international bond issue. It could be placed on a less prestigious foreign market. This could be followed by an international bond issue in a target market or in the eurobond market. The next step might be to cross-list and issue equity in one of the less prestigious markets in order to attract the attention of international investors. The next step could be to cross-list shares on a highly liquid prestigious foreign stock exchange such as London (LSE), NYSE, Euronext, or NASDAQ. The ultimate step sourcing capital abroad could be to place a directed equity issue in a prestigious target market or a euroequity issue in global equity markets.

26) In theory multinational firms are in a better position than domestic firms to support higher debt ratios. Provide an argument as to why this could be true and discuss the empirical research findings about U.S.-based MNEs.
Answer: Access to capital in global markets allows an MNE to lower its cost of equity and debt compared with most domestic firms. The theoretical possibility exists that multinational firms are in a better position than domestic firms to support higher debt ratios because their cash flows are diversified internationally. The probability of a firm's covering fixed charges under varying conditions in product, financial, and foreign exchange markets should increase if the variability of its cash flows is minimized. The diversification argument has been challenged by empirical research findings that MNEs in the United States actually have lower debt ratios than their domestic counterparts. The agency costs of debt were higher for the MNEs, as were political risks, foreign exchange risks, and asymmetric information.

16) ADRs are a popular investment tool for many U.S. investors. In recent years several alternatives for investing in foreign equity securities have become available for U.S. investors, yet ADRs remain popular. Define what an ADR is and provide at least three examples of the advantages they may hold over alternative foreign investment vehicles for U.S. investors. Answer: Depositary receipts are negotiable certificates issued by a bank to represent the underlying shares of stock held in trust at a foreign custodian bank. Those receipts traded in the U.S. and denominated in dollars are called American depositary receipts (ADR). Because ADRs can be exchanged for the underlying foreign security, arbitrage keeps the prices in line. Even though U.S. investors can invest directly into some foreign equity markets, ADRs do offer some technical advantages. Among those advantages are that dividends are received in dollars rather than a foreign currency, ADRs are in registered form rather than bearer form, transfer of ownership is done in accordance with U.S. laws, and in the event of death, probate is in the U.S. and not abroad. Taxes are easier, trading costs are typically lower, and settlement is also faster. Diff: 3

17) List and describe three differences and advantages of Global Registered Shares (GRS) over American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).
Answer: Depositary receipts are negotiable certificates issued by a bank to represent the underlying shares of stock held in trust at a foreign custodian bank. Those receipts traded in the U.S. and denominated in dollars are called American depositary receipts (ADR). ADRs do offer some technical advantages: dividends are received in dollars rather than a foreign currency, ADRs are in registered form rather than bearer form, transfer of ownership is done in accordance with U.S. laws, and in the event of death, probate is in the U.S. and not abroad. Taxes are easier, trading costs are typically lower, and settlement is also faster.
A global registered share (GRS) is a share of equity that is traded across borders and markets without conversion, where one share on the home exchange equals one share on the foreign exchange. If target pricing is important in key markets like that of the U.S., then the ADR offers better opportunities for a foreign firm to gain greater presence and activity. There are two fundamental arguments in favor of GRSs over ADRs, both based on pure forces of globalization:1) Investors and markets alike will continue to grow, 2) Regulations governing security trading across country markets will continue to converge towards a common set of global principles, eliminating the need for securities customized for local market attributes or requirements. Other potential distinctions include the possibility of retaining all voting rights (GRSs do by definition while some ADRs may not) and the general principle that ADRs are designed for one singular cultural and legal environment—the United States.

Answer: EMTNs have maturity between the long-lived international bonds and the short-term Euro-commercial paper, thus they have an appealing time horizon to many investors. EMTNs are like international bonds in that they pay periodic interest. The distinguishing features of an EMTN are: They are similar to a shelf registration in that the entire order for the securities does not have to be issued on the same day. Coupon payments are paid continuously, and the relatively small denominations allow for some flexibility in the market.

28) Explain the worldwide and territorial approaches of national taxation. The authors state that the United States uses both approaches. How can this be? Give an example of each taxation approach.
Answer: The worldwide approach taxes the income of firms based on their place of residence rather than on where the income was earned. Thus, a U.S. based MNE will owe U.S. taxes on income earned in, say, Britain. The territorial approach to taxation taxes all of the income earned within the borders of the country by both domestic and foreign-based firms. Thus, a British- based firm making sales in New York will owe taxes in the U.S.
Through a series of bilateral tax agreements, the U.S. and several trading partners have tried to workout tax issues. Generally, the taxes a U.S. based MNE pays abroad will help offset any required taxes the firm might have on funds remitted to the United States.

29) What is a value-added tax? Where is this type of tax in wide usage? Why do you suppose
this form of taxation has NOT been widely accepted in the United States?
Answer: A value-added tax (VAT) is a form of national sales tax, where goods are taxed at each step of extraction, production, wholesale, and retail. A VAT tax is considered regressive because those with lower incomes pay the same taxes on a particular commodity as those with more money. Americans have never taken to this type of national tax because the most similar type of state and local tax is the sales tax, and that has always been the domain of the states. Plus the fact that it is regressive make the tax a tough sell to taxpayers.

26) What is a transfer price, and can a government regulate it? What difficulties and motives does a parent multinational firm face in setting transfer prices?
Answer: A transfer price is the amount paid by one unit of a company (domestic or international) for goods or services purchased from another unit of the same firm. As such, a transfer price is needed for every intrafirm transaction. Where buyer and seller are in different tax jurisdictions (i.e., countries), governments are concerned with the possibility that transfer prices are raised or lowered from a "normal" or "appropriate" level in order to avoid taxes. In most countries tax authorities have the right to declare a given international transfer price as a tax avoidance device. Such countries have the right to reset taxable income to a higher level. The motives for the parent MNE are to minimize taxes, and the difficulty is that the burden of proof is on the MNE, not the tax collector, to show proof as to why a given transfer price is reasonable.

28) Why do the U.S. tax authorities tax passive income generated offshore differently from
active income?
Answer: One type of passive income would simply be the distributed profits of another company, dividends, if the foreign company owned it. Without the differential treatment, it would only make sense for most U.S. multinationals to create a holding company in a tax haven, which would then own all the foreign subsidiaries of the company. Then, all the profits earned by the Holding Company would be retained in a low tax environment without incurring any U.S. tax liabilities.

15.3 Google: An Illustrative Case of Profit Repositioning
1) Why is it core to Google's tax planning to fix a tax base (also known as permanent establishment) in Ireland?
Answer: Permanent establishment rules allow firms such as Google to fix a tax base in a low- tax country like Ireland, while generating lots of business in a country where tax rates are higher, like France. Companies in principle are taxed not on "where they do business," but on "where they finalize their business deals with customers" —the country or jurisdiction where the final contract is signed. In the case of Google, that means most sales throughout the European Union are finalized in Ireland. It is estimated that 75% of the top 50 U.S. software, Internet, and computer hardware companies use similar PE structures that help them avoid taxes.

16) Why might different documentation be used for an export to a nonaffiliated foreign buyer who is a new customer, as compared with an export to a nonaffiliated foreign buyer to whom the exporter has been selling for many years?
Answer: A new nonaffiliated buyer presents a credit risk for the exporter, because the exporter may be unable to assess the creditworthiness of that importer due to geographic distance, language, culture, or lack of a record of payments to other suppliers. A letter of credit, accompanied by other documents, allows the exporter to rely on the credit standing of a bank, which is presumed to be of greater creditworthiness than just an unknown manufacturing firm.
After successful trade goes on for some time the importer becomes a known entity, in which case the exporter will have more faith in the importer's willingness and ability to pay. Because the letter of credit and other documents have both a financial cost and a cost for the time and energy involved in handling the documents, direct billing for exports is easier, faster, and lowers the final end-cost to the ultimate customer.

17) For what reason might an exporter use standard international trade documentation (letter of credit, draft, order bill of lading) on an intrafirm export to its parent or sister subsidiary?
Answer: An export to a parent or sister subsidiary has no credit risk because both exporter and importer are part of the same corporate unit. Non-payment to an exporter in this situation is just a matter of keeping the firm's cash in another corporate account. In fact, very late payment for an export to an affiliated importer might be desirable, because the firm wants to keep cash in one location and not in another. Nevertheless, an export to an affiliated buyer might pass through the standard documentation as a way to obtain financing that is easy to obtain, is possibly cheaper than alternative sources of short-term financing, or provides some protection against political or country-based interruption to payment for the transaction.

18) What is the major difference between "currency risk" and "risk of noncompletion"? How are these risks handled in a typical international trade transaction?
Answer: Currency risk is the risk that the currency designated for payment of the import changes in value relative to the other currency. A U.S. firm exporting to France wants dollars, while the French importer wants to pay euros. If the sale contract specifies payment in dollars, the French importer has a currency risk—more euros than expected might be needed when payment is due. If the sales contract specifies payment in euros, the U.S. exporter has a currency risk—fewer dollars than expected might be received when the euros are exchanged for dollars. Risk of noncompletion is the risk that one of the parties fails to fulfill its obligations. The importer may refuse to pay for the goods, or the exporter may fail to ship the goods. Events not under the control of the parties to the trade, such as major storms, disease epidemics, terrorist acts, or war, may make completion of the trade impossible. The several documents involved in international trade are intended to reduce financial loss from noncompletion.

27) Explain what a letter of credit (L/C) is, who the principle parties are, what the principle advantage is, and how the L/C facilitates international trade.
Answer: A letter of credit (L/C) is a bank's conditional promise to pay issued by a bank at the request of an importer. The primary advantage of an L/C is the reduction in risk. This reduction in risk makes it easier for the exporter to sell goods to the importer because it no longer need rely on the ability of the importing firm to pay for the goods, but rather it can rely on the bank.
There are three primary parties involved with a letter of credit. Party number one is the exporter, who makes a sale to the importer in exchange for the bank's L/C. Party number two is the importer who receives the goods and promises to pay the bank. And third, the bank that contracts with the importer and agrees to pay the exporter upon presentation of documents as specified in the L/C.
The advantage to an exporter is the increased likelihood of receiving payment because funds are due from a known international commercial bank as opposed to a relatively unknown importer. Furthermore, an exporter with a good reputation for delivery may be able to sell the L/C at a discount in the secondary market prior to shipping and speed up cash flow.
The importer benefits because it doesn't need to pay for goods purchased until they actually reach port. The bank benefits from the fees they charge.

13) What is a banker's acceptance? How are they initiated? Why are they desirable for the exporter?
Answer: A draft, or bill of exchange, is a written order from the exporter telling the importer when and how much to pay. When properly contracted, a draft can become a negotiable instrument and trade in the secondary market. If the draft provides a specific payment date and is presented to the importer's bank, it becomes a banker's acceptance (BA) and the bank makes an unconditional promise to make payment upon maturity. A BA may sell in the secondary market like any other marketable security and the holder need not wait until maturity to liquidate. Thus, BAs facilitate trade by reducing risk and potentially speeding cash flows to the exporter.

Answer: The strategic motives for firms to become multinationals could be: market seekers, raw materials seekers, production efficiency seekers, knowledge seekers, and political safety seekers. Market seekers are looking for more consumers for their products such as automobiles, or steel. Knowledge seekers may be looking for an educated workforce similar to the way firms seeking R and D set up shop in university towns. Raw materials seekers may be after commodities such as oil or copper. Production efficiencies may occur in countries like Mexico that have capable workers and lower wages. Political safety seekers are looking for countries that will not expropriate their assets, so they may stay away from countries that in the post have engaged in such activities.

17) What does the OLI Paradigm propose to explain? Define each component and provide an example of each.
Answer: The OLI Paradigm is an attempt to develop an overall framework to explain why MNEs choose FDI to serve foreign markets rather than alternatives such as licensing or exporting. The letters of the paradigm are O for owner-specific advantages, L for location- specific advantages, and I for internalization.
Owner-specific advantages require that the firm have a comparative advantage in its home market that it feels it can exploit internationally. To be most effective, the advantages should be difficult to copy. Location specific advantages may be due to market imperfections or genuine comparative advantages such as a source of a particularly high quality natural resource. With internalization the firm has in its possession some proprietary information or product such as software or personnel that may provide an advantage in the international marketplace.

19) The decision about where to invest abroad is influenced by behavioral factors. Explain the behavioral approach to FDI.
Answer: The behavioral approach to analyzing the FDI decision is typified by the so-called Swedish School of economists. The Swedish School has rather successfully explained not just the initial decision to invest abroad, but also later decisions to reinvest elsewhere, and to change the structure of a firm's international involvement over time. Based on the internationalization process of a sample of Swedish MNEs, the economists observed that these firms tended to invest first in countries that were not too far distant in psychic terms. Close psychic distance defined countries with a cultural, legal, and institutional environment similar to Sweden's, such as Norway, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The initial investments were modest in size, to minimize the risk of an uncertain foreign environment. As the Swedish firms learned from their initial investments, they became willing to take greater risks with respect to both the psychic distance of the countries, and the size of the investments.

20) What are the advantages and disadvantages of serving a foreign market through a greenfield foreign direct investment compared to an acquisition of a local firm in the target market? Answer: A greenfield investment is defined as establishing a production or service facility starting from the ground up, i.e., from a green field. Compared to greenfield investment, a cross- border acquisition has a number of significant advantages. First and foremost, it is quicker. Greenfield investment frequently requires extended periods of physical construction and organizational development. By acquiring an existing firm, the MNE can shorten the time required to gain a presence and facilitate competitive entry into the market. Second, acquisition may be a cost-effective way of gaining competitive advantages such as technology, brand names valued in the target market, and logistical and distribution advantages, while simultaneously eliminating a local competitor. Third, international economic, political, and foreign exchange conditions may result in market imperfections, allowing target firms to be undervalued. Many enterprises throughout Asia have been the target of acquisition as a result of the Asian economic crisis's impact on their financial health. Many enterprises were in dire need of capital injections for competitive survival.
Cross-border acquisitions are not, however, without their pitfalls. As with all acquisitions— domestic or international—there are the frequent problems of paying too high a price, or suffering a method of financing that is too costly. Meshing different corporate cultures can be traumatic. Managing the post-acquisition process is frequently characterized by downsizing to gain economies of scale and scope in overhead functions. This results in nonproductive impacts on the firm as individuals attempt to save their own jobs. Internationally, additional difficulties arise from host governments intervening in pricing, financing, employment guarantees, market segmentation, and general nationalism and favoritism. In fact, the ability to complete international acquisitions successfully may itself be a test of the MNE's competence in the twenty-first century.

10) What are blocked funds? List and explain two of the three methods the authors list in this chapter for dealing with blocked funds.
Answer: Blocked funds are those that have been restricted from foreign exchange in some fashion by the government of the host country. If this is a potential problems firms take a number of steps to reduce or minimize the impact of such a governmental action. In this chapter the authors identify three techniques for dealing with the problem of blocked funds. First, using fronting loans. Here the firm deposits money into a large financial institution, typically in a neutral third country, and then has the bank loan the same amount to the foreign subsidiary. There are several reasons why governments are more likely to allow repayments of such loans as opposed to repayment to the parent.
Second, the local firm may create new exports thus increasing the flow of currency into the country and achieving the goals of the government. Third, the authors also mention a special dispensation whereby firms in highly desirable and specialized industries such as telecommunications or pharmaceuticals are contractually guaranteed repatriation of funds at a greater rate than normal.

11) An investment agreement spells out specific rights and responsibilities of both the foreign firm and the host government. What are the main financial policies that should be included in an investment agreement?
Answer: An investment agreement spells out specific rights and responsibilities of both the foreign firm and the host government. The presence of MNEs is as often sought by development- seeking host governments as a particular foreign location is sought by an MNE. All parties have alternatives, and so bargaining is appropriate. An investment agreement should spell out policies on financial and managerial issues, including the following:
- The basis on which fund flows, such as dividends, management fees, royalties, patent fees, and loan repayments, may be remitted.
- The basis for setting transfer prices.
- The right to export to third-country markets.
- Obligations to build, or fund, social and economic overhead projects, such as schools, hospitals, and retirement systems.
- Methods of taxation, including the rate, the type of taxation, and means by which the rate base is determined.
- Access to host-country capital markets, particularly for long-term borrowing.
- Permission for 100% foreign ownership versus required local ownership (joint venture) participation.
- Price controls, if any, applicable to sales in the host-country markets.
- Requirements for local sourcing versus import of raw materials and components.
- Permission to use expatriate managerial and technical personnel, and to bring them and their personal possessions into the country free of exorbitant charges or import duties.
- Provision for arbitration of disputes.

19) The authors highlight a strong theoretical argument in favor of analyzing any foreign project from the viewpoint of the parent. Provide at least three reasons why the parent's viewpoint is superior to the local viewpoint and give an example of when the local viewpoint fails to maximize the value of the firm.
Answer: A project might have a positive NPV from the local viewpoint, but fail to consider relevant cash flows from the parent viewpoint. For example, a positive NPV project in one country may result from the erosion of revenues in another. A local manager would not necessarily be expected to be aware of such erosion. It may not be possible to remit all or part of the local cash flows to the parent company and reinvestment opportunities in the local economy may be inferior to what the parent could do elsewhere, thus, a less than maximum use of funds. Political and exchange rate risk add to the uncertainty of cash flows and thus increase the required rate of return by stockholders. Cash flows may be more difficult to estimate especially long-term cash flows in lesser-developed countries.

Instruction 18.1:
Use the information to answer the following question(s).
The Velo Rapid Revolutions Inc., a company that produces bicycles, elliptical trainers, scooters and other wheeled non-motorized recreational equipment, is considering an expansion of their product line to Europe. The expansion would require a purchase of equipment with a price of €1,200,000 and additional installation of €300,000 (assume that the installation costs cannot be expensed, but rather, must be depreciated over the life of the asset). Because this would be a new product, they will not be replacing existing equipment. The new product line is expected to increase revenues by €600,000 per year over current levels for the next 5 years, however; expenses will also increase by €200,000 per year. (Note: Assume the after-tax operating cash flows in years 1-5 are equal, and that the terminal value of the project in year 5 may change total after-tax cash flows for that year.) The equipment is multipurpose and the firm anticipates that they will sell it at the end of the five years for €500,000. The firm's required rate of return is 12% and they are in the 40% tax bracket. Depreciation is straight-line to a value of euro 0 over the 5- year life of the equipment, and the initial investment (at year 0) also requires an increase in NWC of €100,000 (to be recovered at the sale of the equipment at the end of five years). The current spot rate is $0.95/euro, and the expected inflation rate in the U.S. is 4% per year and 3% per year in Europe.
7) Refer to Instruction 18.1. What is the initial investment for the Velo Rapid Revolutions project?

22) Explain how political risk and exchange rate risk increase the uncertainty of international projects for the purpose of capital budgeting.
Answer: The evaluation of foreign projects must consider several risks that are either nonexistent or much less important in domestic capital budgeting. First, if revenues and expenses are in a foreign currency, then the parent firm must estimate the exchange rate at which the foreign currency will be converted into the domestic currency. To estimate future exchange rates, the parent firm must estimate expected rates of inflation and interest rates in both countries, economic growth in each country, as well as consumer preferences and tastes in more than one country. Then, aspects of political risk must be considered. What is the likelihood that all or part of the cash flows accruing to the parent firm will be restricted through some political act? The firm must now consider the possibility of changing tax rates, new taxes, and additional restrictions on the flow of funds. Furthermore, local norms may differ from usual firm practice in terms of financing or dividend policy. Domestic capital budgeting may seem quite easy in comparison.

4) What is real option analysis? How is it a better method of making investment decisions than using traditional capital budgeting analysis?
Answer: Real options is a different way of thinking about investment values. At its core, it is a cross between decision-tree analysis and pure option-based valuation. It is particularly useful when analyzing investment projects that will follow very different value paths at decision points in time where management decisions are made regarding project pursuit. This wide range of potential outcomes is at the heart of real option theory. Real option valuation also allows us to analyze a number of managerial decisions that in practice characterize many major capital investment projects:
1. The option to defer
2. The option to abandon
3. The option to alter capacity
4. The option to start up or shut down (switching)
Real option analysis treats cash flows in terms of future value in a positive sense, whereas DCF treats future cash flows negatively (on a discounted basis). Real option analysis is a particularly powerful device when addressing potential investment projects with extremely long life spans or investments that do not commence until future dates.
Real option analysis acknowledges the way information is gathered over time to support decision-making. Management learns from both active (searching it out) and passive (observing market conditions) knowledge-gathering and then uses this knowledge to make better decisions. Diff: 2
